# pairs_trading_HJB_optimization

 ● Engineered a stochastic control-based pairs trading framework, modeling spread dynamics with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes 
and deriving optimal portfolio weights via the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation for dynamic, utility-maximizing rebalancing.  

● Developed a Python-based pipeline integrating cointegration analysis for asset pair selection, parameter estimation via maximum 
likelihood, and Geometric Brownian Motion simulations to model asset prices and spread behavior. 

● Backtested real-world and simulated data with transaction cost modeling, achieving above-average returns while highlighting 
challenges in adapting to non-stationary markets.
